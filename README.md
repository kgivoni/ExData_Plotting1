# Solution for Course Project 1, Exploratory Data

This submission includes the following files:
<ol>
<li>get_data.R --> retrieve the data, add date formatting and remove unnecessary data (according to the guidelines) </li>
<li>plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R --> R script to generate each one of the plots</li>
<li>plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, plot4.png --> The result of running the R scripts above </li>
</ol>

## How to run?
It is assumed that the data file given in this link: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
is downloaded, unzipped and found in the subdirectory "data", under current working directory.
(the extracted file name is: household_power_consumption.txt)

All R scripts (get_data.r, plot[1-4].R) should be copied to the current working directory.

## In order to run any of the plot[1-4].R files, type:
\> source("plot1.R") # or "plot2.R" / "plot3.R" / "plot4.R"

There is no need to run get_data.R seperately (it will be called by the other scripts).

Thank you.
